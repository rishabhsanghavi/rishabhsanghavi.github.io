I am an incoming graduate student in the chemical engineering department at University of Washington. I completed a year-long industrial internship as a process modeling engineer at Archer Daniels Midland Company and a deep learning internship in computational chemistry at Corteva Agrisciences in 2021. I received my BS in chemical engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2020.
